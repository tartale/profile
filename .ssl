# A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
# keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
#   /opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@3/certs

# and run
#   /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin/c_rehash

# openssl@3 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
# because macOS provides LibreSSL.

# If you need to have openssl@3 first in your PATH, run:
#   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"

# # For compilers to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
#   export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib"
#   export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include"

# # For pkg-config to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
#   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig"
